	//write a function "allocate10" that allocates space for 10 integer using the parameter list
	//in other words the function is of VOID type, takes a parameter and allocates and assigns memory to that parameter
	//call the function to allocate and assign memory to a
	//use a loop in the function to assign a[0] to a[9] to integers 0 to 9 
	//print the values out one per line in the main program
	//To be clear - the memory is allocated and assigning values happens in the function
	//in the main function
 //free the memory in a
 //*******************************************************

 //*******************************************************
 //1 mark 
 //Write a function "joinStrings" takes as parameters 3 strings. It joins the first 2 together and puts the result in the third string
 //The function allocates memory for the third string using malloc
 //apply the function to strings b,c, and d. After the function is done d should have memory allocated to it and contain "Hello World"
 //the function should not assume the sizes of b or c - it needs to be general enough for any string
 //after calling the function using b,c,d as parameters print out d from the main function
 //free the memory in d

 //write a function "arrayWrite" that takes as parameters an array of the same type as e, the size of the first dimension, and a string variables, binaryFilename
 //the function "arrayWrite" writes the values of the the array (starting from array[0][0] and ending at array[size-1][2]) to the binaryFilename
 //apply the function to array e and file1

 //write a function "binaryIO" to take as a parameter two filenames
 //it opens the first file which is binary reads in sizeof(int) bytes at a time
 //it writes value and the value squared separated by a ',' one set of values per line i.e.
 //0,0
 //1,1
 //2,4 
 //etc. to a the second file
 //
 //run the function with parameters e,file1, file2
 //so at the end of this there should be two new files

 //malloc and assign memory for g as a pointer to pointer to integer where you assign the pointers to a block of memory the size of e
	//write a function "arrayCopy" that that takes parameters of the same type as e, f, and g and a sizes array parameter
	//sizes is an array of the dimension sizes
	//use for loops to copy values of e to f and g inside the function
	//in main print out e, f and g
 //in main free the memory for f
 //in main free the memory for g
